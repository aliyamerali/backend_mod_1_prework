## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?  

 There were a few different pieces of the article that I found interesting:
  * _Reading_: I hadn't thought about this previously, but I do find that I'm happier and more productive when I have a book I'm reading for leisure. I'm going to try to always have a fiction book that I'm actively reading throughout the Turing experience to help foster a "freedom to roam" for my mind.
  * _Learning as a process, not a destination_: This is something I'm actively working on now, and want to continue to focus on throughout the program. I find that with many things in my life I end up doing them to "check it off the list," e.g., instead of leading with curiosity about the experience.
  * _Teach and use what you learn_: This is something I try to do in my note-taking process - be re-writing my notes in a better format after taking them live, I'm able to reorganize and reiterate the information. It's not quite the same as teaching, but I think has a similar outcome. Something I'd like to try to do in this process is find more opportunities for teaching to help solidify what I'm learning.
  * _Take Breaks_: I didn't do this previously, but have started using the Pomodoro method (and Chrome plugin) since starting Turing. It has been helpful so far, though I do find that I have a tendency to say "just one more minute" when the break prompt comes up, and then actually spend another 30 minutes or so working. I want to find the balance between getting in a "flow" state and being proactive about healthy breaks.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
  `p "Hello World!"`  
   _or_  
  `print "Hello World!"`  
   _or_  
  `puts "Hello World!"`  
  depending on how I want the output to appear.

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?  
  The octothorp (`#`, also known as the pound sign) indicates a comment in a ruby file.

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?  
  An integer is a whole number (4, e.g.), where as a float is a number with decimal points (4.0, e.g.).

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`  
  `animal = "zebra"`

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?  
  `puts animal`  

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.  
  `puts "I gave my niece a #{animal} stuffed animal for Christmas this year."`

1. What method is used to get input from a user?  
  You can use `gets.chomp` to take in user input. The `gets` method brings in the user input as a string, and the `chomp` method eliminates the new line at the end of the user input.

1. Name and describe two common string methods:  
  Two common string methods are:
    * `.length`, which returns the number of characters in a string (including spaces)
    * `.split()`, which breaks up a string by the character passed into the method (or by spaces, if there is no argument passed to the method) and returns an array with each piece of the string as an element of the array.
